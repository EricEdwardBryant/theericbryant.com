I am interested in using genetic interactions to develop a reasoned
understanding of how and why cancers respond to chemotherapy.
I became interested in this field of research prior to coming to Columbia
University while working at Gene Oracle – a small biotech startup specializing
in de-novo gene synthesis.
While at Gene Oracle, I helped design and execute approaches for constructing
massive mutant libraries for use in proprietary genetic interaction assays.
After two years at Gene Oracle I decided I wanted to pursue studies of genetic
interactions in the context of DNA replication & repair with a focus on lesions
common to cancer.
This interest led me to my current role as a graduate student research
assistant in the lab of Rodney Rothstein.
Rodney is a leader in the field of DNA repair and, at the time of joining his
lab, work had begun developing a cost-effective pipeline for identifying
genetic interactions relevant to cancer, similar to the interaction found
between PARP inhibitors and BRCA mutant cancers.
Rodney’s lab has given me the encouragement, flexibility and guidance to
develop an expertise in bioinformatics, genomics, and large-scale data analysis
that is essential for deriving insights from our pipeline.
My work over the last couple of years has resulted in several exciting leads,
of which, I have chosen to focus on studying the mechanism of HLTF (RAD5)
dosage interactions as this protein is commonly amplified & overexpressed in
cancer, is functionally conserved in our model system and plays a critical role
in tolerance to DNA replication blocking drugs commonly used to treat cancer.
With help from the TRANSFORM TL1 grant, I have been working to transition my
work from a yeast model to a model more closely related to humans in an attempt
to translate my knowledge of genetic interaction networks, DNA replication &
repair, and genomics to clinically relevant insights.
I have established a fruitful collaboration with my TL1 co-mentor, Alberto
Ciccia, who also studies DNA replication and repair, but in human cell lines
using cutting edge genetic tools.
This collaboration has resulted in one co-first author paper on the application
of double-strand break free methods of CRISPR-mediated base editing for
generating nonsense mutations.
This work is a valuable step towards improving methods for modeling loss of
function mutations in models that are not as genetically tractable as yeast –
my current model system. We are now working to expand this study from the
perspective of reversing clinically relevant nonsense mutations.

My pre-doctoral research is focused on applying synthetic genetic interaction
networks as a tool for rational development of precision therapeutics.
For example, in a paper published in the summer of 2016, our lab used yeast as
a model to study the genetic consequences of CKS1 overexpression.
In this study, we characterized the yeast synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) genetic
interaction signature for yeast CKS1, and found that CKS1 overexpression
requires a functional polo-like kinase (PLK).
My contribution to this work involved leveraging data from The Cancer Genome
Atlas and publically available shRNA screens performed on large panels of
cancer cells lines to determine whether there was corroborating evidence for a
conserved CKS1-PLK SDL interaction in human cells.
Indeed, CKS1 amplification and corresponding overexpression rarely occurs in
patient samples with low levels of PLK.
Emboldened by this corroborating evidence, we then confirmed that CKS1
overexpression sensitized human cells to a known PLK inhibitor, and, as
predicted by our genetic interaction network, PLK inhibition and WEE1
inhibition were antagonistic (for details, see Reid, et al. 2016). 

Recently, I have been working on a similar story modeling the consequences of
RAD5 overexpression.
Here we found that RAD5 overexpression causes a requirement for homologous
recombination (HR) and sensitizes cells to replication blocking agents such as
cisplatin.
Interestingly, mutations in either of two major functional domains of RAD5 did
not eliminate the requirement for HR.
Undeterred, I pursued a poorly studied domain of RAD5 with a published partial
structure from the human ortholog - HLTF.
After homology modeling, I performed a set of focused alanine scans and
determined two essential residues that, when mutated, eliminate the requirement
for HR and relieve sensitivity to cisplatin.
We have recently identified the mechanism of RAD5’s SDL interactions in that
RAD5 overexpression results in remodeling of DNA replication forks into
structures that require cross-over resolution.

In collaboration with the Ciccia lab at CUMC’s cancer center, I have worked on
a feasibility study for applying CRISPR mediated base editing as a means for
introducing premature stop codons without having to cut DNA.
We have determined that nearly 99% of human transcripts can be engineered with
an early stop codon, with a targetable site occurring approximately once every
25 amino acid residues.
Our paper discusses several applications of this technology to modeling human
diseases, especially in cancer where somatic mutations introduce premature stop
codons in many different genes and recurrently in common tumor suppressors.
As a follow-up to this paper we are studying the contribution of nonsense
mutations in human disease and developing tools and resources to help
researchers identify whether a particular nonsense mutation is amenable to
base-editing approaches for stop codon reversal.

Finally, in addition to the premature stop codon work in the Ciccia lab, I am
also contributing to the bioinformatic analysis of a large set of CRISPRi/a
experiments designed to reveal the genomic requirements for sensitivity and
resistance to DNA damaging agents commonly used to treat cancer.
This work complements a cisplatin epistasis map we are working on in the
Rothstein lab.
I look forward to taking the lessons and skills I have learned from working
with yeast and applying them to human cells in a productive collaboration with
the Ciccia lab.
